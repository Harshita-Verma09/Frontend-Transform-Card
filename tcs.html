                    already in office thrice a weeek. We hfave given a 12-15% raise for exceptional<br>
                    performers in our latest annual compensation review, and also commenced the<br>
                    promotions cycle. TCSers logged 12.7 million learning hourse in upskilling<br>
                    themselves during the quarter in market relevant skills like generative AI, cloud,<br>
                    data and analytics. Our attrition continues to trend down and we expect it to be<br>
                    back in our our industry-leading, long term range in the second half of the year.<br>
                    While we are committed to honour all the offers we have made, our focus will be<br>
